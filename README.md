In this excercise I'm learning how to style html pages using css.
It's mostly how to use selectors and how they improve the performance of your page.

So we start of with a md file and convert it to htlm and then add styling elements using css.

At the moment I'm struggling with styling my table.
I'm trying to select individual rows but end up mixing up the elements.
