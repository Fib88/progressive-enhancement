# progressive-enhancement

In this excercise I'm learning how to style html pages using css.
It's mostly how to use selectors and how they improve the performance of your page.

So we start of with a md file and convert it to htlm and then add styling elements using css.

At the moment I'm struggling with styling my table.
I'm trying to select individual rows but end up mixing up the elements.

###update:
Fixed my table using (even) & (odd) instead of individual child selectors.
Also fixed the background color of my table rows by going for tr instead of td 
Included the correct viewport in the header.
