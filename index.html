    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <blockquote class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote> The farmer said, <blockquote>“Maybe.”</blockquote> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<blockquote>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</blockquote> The farmer again said, <blockquote>“Maybe.”</blockquote>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<blockquote class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</blockquote> and the farmer responded, <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <blockquote class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote> Again, he said, <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p><br>

    <table>
        <tr><th>Event</th><th class="Good" class="Bad"> Good or Bad?</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Lose a horse</td><td><em>Maybe</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Win more horses</td><td><em>Maybe</em></td></tr>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <blockquote>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</blockquote>
